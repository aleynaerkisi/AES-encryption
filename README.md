AES encryption for 128 bit message

Project takes a message of 16 characters. Then encrypt it. In first round it doesn't do the initial step of 'xor'ing the cypher key with addRoundKey.
It wil be fixed later only one line of code is missing. 
Other than that it works perfectly but could be more optimizated.
